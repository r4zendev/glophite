# Glophite layout for MoErgo's Glove80

This is my layout for MoErgo's Glove80 board. It uses [Graphite layout](https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout) with swapped Q and X keys.
It is planned to add a [magic key](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2042) that would complete hard bigrams and in general ease typing of some common words and bigrams/trigrams.
